Good
- Touched all the aspects
- Recent work experience first 
- Tech heavy words in the introduction 
- Functional requirements took too long (~10min)
- When to share the information is critical 
- Functional Requirements should be clear (1,2,3 Go)
- No deep-tech discussion in functional requirements 
- Don't take time coming up with non-technical   
- Non-functional requirements should be led by logic as opposed to a fact. BoE calculations
- size, usercount, visits
- Niche use cases   
- Core entities - user, content store, interaction store etc.
- NFR : Highly reliable, Secure 
- Draft out APIs 
- 1-2 Deep dives
- Trade offs from NFR
- Simplify terms and words
- Holding on too strong to a structure
- Narration 
- Convince language choice
- Focus on the problem not the tech 
- Don't re-iterate the same points or the problem statement
- Exact infrastructure at the end 

Functional -> API/HLD 
Non-functional -> Deep Dives

- Scalability: How should the handle increase in load
- Reliability: Fault tolerant / acceptable downtime
- Performance: Latency and throughput requirements
- Availability: Desired uptime
- Consistency: 
- Security:
